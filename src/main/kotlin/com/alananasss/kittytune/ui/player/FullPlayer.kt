/**
 * The player at the size of the window, built from the reference he sent (issue #33).
 *
 * ## Why there was a first attempt and why this is not it
 *
 * The first one was described, not shown: "the cover appears on the left, text appears on the right […]
 * all buttons such as rewind the next track, last track, volume, shuffle, etc. it's under the cover". I
 * built exactly that on the app's own surface colour, with a large filled play button and a cover sized
 * to most of the height, and the verdict was "c'est très très mauvais". Fair — the words describe the
 * arrangement and say nothing about what makes the thing worth looking at.
 *
 * Then he sent a screenshot of Apple Music's, and everything that was wrong is in it:
 *
 *  - **The colour is the record's.** Full-bleed, saturated, with one soft bloom off the top right corner.
 *    Not a panel colour with a cover placed on it — the cover is where the whole screen's colour comes
 *    from, which is why [ThemeState.coverSeedColor] is read directly here rather than going through the
 *    scheme.
 *  - **The cover is small.** About a third of the width, left of centre, with air around it. It is not
 *    trying to be the biggest thing on screen; the words are.
 *  - **The controls are quiet.** A hairline progress bar, times at the ends, small glyphs. No filled
 *    primary button — nothing in that screenshot asks to be pressed, because the screen is for reading.
 *  - **The words are enormous and mostly transparent.** The line being sung is nearly opaque and the rest
 *    are the same white at a third of it, so the page reads as one block of text with a lit line in it.
 *
 * ## One lyrics renderer, told to look different
 *
 * The words are [PanelLyrics] — the renderer the side panel already uses, which follows the song, handles
 * word-by-word and untimed text, and honours every lyrics setting. It reads its colours and its type from
 * the theme, so instead of adding parameters to it (or copying it, which is how the sidebar ended up with
 * two layouts that disagreed for three rounds) this hands it a *local* theme: white on the record's
 * colour, at four times the size. One renderer, one place where the following logic lives, and a caller
 * that says what it should look like.

/**
 * Several huge soft lights of the record's colour, drifting.
 *
 * No longer the background it was written to be: [FluidArtworkBackground] is, and this stands in for the
 * second or so before the sleeve has been decoded — plus for good on a track that has no artwork, or a
 * machine whose driver refuses the shader. Kept rather than deleted because those cases are exactly the ones
 * a flat rectangle would look broken in, and this is a background that needs nothing but four colours.
 *
 * "Refais aussi le fond car un fond simple comme ça c'est pas ouf, refais-le entièrement, faut que ça claque
 * mais lisible."
 *
 * Three attempts. A flat colour with one bloom in the corner was "pas ouf". Four tints of the single dominant
 * colour, rotated a few degrees apart, was better on a colourful sleeve and produced a flat dark grey
 * rectangle on a nearly black one — which is the screenshot that prompted this, and the reason is that a
 * palette faked from one colour is still one colour.
 *
 * So the lights are the sleeve's own *shades* now — "le fond est animé sur différentes nuances de la cover" —
 * read from the same histogram the theme's seed comes from and keeping the brightness they had there, which is
 * why one corner of this screen can be nearly cream while another is nearly black. See
 * [ArtworkPalette.meshPalette] for what is held back and why. Four of them move; the fifth and darkest is the
 * ground they move over.
 *
 * "Faut que ça claque mais lisible" is the constraint that sets every number here. Claquer is the travel —
 * a light crosses forty per cent of the screen, so a corner that was cream becomes deep red inside half a
 * minute. Lisible is the radius: wide enough that no light has an edge sharp enough to catch a line of text
 * on, because a hard boundary behind a word is what makes a pretty background unreadable.
